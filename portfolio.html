        <h2>Scrapbook App: Life in Pixels</h2>
        <p>Using App Inventor, my partner and I created a scrapbooking/collage app where users can display their memories in a creative visual output by adding their own pictures, text, doodles, and set stickers.
        REFLECTION: My app was able to cover majority of its intended purpose. There were some components that could have vastly improved our product client's needs if we had more time. We were not able to figure out how to allow users to save the page they created and add more to continue "scrapbooking." In addition, our product was not as aesthetically pleasing as we had hoped for it to be.</p>
