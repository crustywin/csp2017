    <p>HELLO! My name is Christine Nguyen and I am currently a Junior at Rowland High School.</p>

    	<h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
    	<p2>After-school cram sessions at the local Starbucks were an everyday occurrence for me during sophomore year. “I have a caramel macchiato for Christine!” I had the biggest smile on my face, thrilled to finally get my caffeine fix, and politely thanked the barista when she suddenly joked, “You’re always smiling, aren’t you?” I laughed and brushed the comment aside. Then, I realized that I received that comment quite often. I am a firm believer of optimism and understand the cruciality of maintaining a positive outlook in order to truly be satisfied with life. Not to say that I don’t get bombarded by waves of stress and anxiety from school and extracurriculars, but I try my best to persevere and work toward my goals. 
I am a perfectionist; I am an artist; but I am also a klutz who drops everything (my phone is clear evidence of that); I am a passionate lover of service. The most impactful event that has happened to me in my high school career was joining Key Club; a service organization that stresses the values of inclusiveness, caring, character-building, and leadership. I have met countless amazing individuals who I am thankful to call friends and experienced pivotal moments that have genuinely touched my heart and fed my growing passion for service.
